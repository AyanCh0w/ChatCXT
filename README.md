This application combines GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) with Google webscraping to provide up-to-date answers to user queries. GPT is deep learning technology used to generate natural language text and Google webscraping provides information from the web. The application utilizes both of these technologies to quickly generate responses to user queries, however, it is important to note that some of the responses may be inaccurate as this is still in beta.
